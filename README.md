# Project: **Browser-use Assisted Flow Recorder**

### Problem Statement

Browser-use is a promising framework for AI-driven automation, but based on my extensive usage for QA automation, I‚Äôve observed several challenges:

* **Instruction following issues:** LLMs like GPT-4.1 often skip essential actions in multi-step tests.
* **Model tradeoffs:** Claude 4 Sonnet handles instruction following better, but it‚Äôs slow and expensive (\~\$2.50 for a 25-step test).
* **Wrong element interactions:** If browser-use acts on the wrong element, subsequent steps still continue instead of failing early.
* **Custom UI elements:** Many enterprise apps use in-house icons unfamiliar to LLMs. Agents misidentify them, especially when elements lack useful attributes.
* **No relative selectors:** Unlike Cypress/Selenium, identifying elements relative to nearby elements is hard with browser-use.
* **Debugging difficulty:** Without step-by-step execution during test creation, users write long tasks (20‚Äì30 steps) only to discover failures deep inside, wasting time in debugging.

---

### My Idea

I propose a **Flow Recorder** that combines **manual recording** (like workflow-use) with **browser-use agent interactions**, solving the above pain points.

* Users can **record manual interactions** and **agent-driven steps** side by side.
* The **steps export as JSON**, which can:

  * Feed into Cursor/VSCode for generating robust test automation code (Cypress, Selenium, Playwright).
  * Be reused as **initial/final/manual actions** for browser-use.

This bridges the gap between **human precision** and **AI-driven automation**.

---

### Why This Matters

* **Practicality:** QA engineers are already used to manual recorders (LambdaTest, KaneAI, etc.), validating this idea.
* **Flexibility:** Manual + Agent interaction recording reduces reliance on LLM correctness alone.
* **Debuggability:** Step-by-step creation and export make tests easier to validate and maintain.
* **Adoption:** Enterprises can gradually adopt browser-use by combining familiar workflows with AI assistance.

---

### Future Work

* Integrate visual assertions so execution halts if an unexpected element interaction occurs.
* Add relative element selection support.
* Optimize cost by minimizing redundant LLM calls.

üëâ This way, the project demonstrates both **a real-world QA testing problem** and **a practical hybrid solution**.

    "id": "unique_id",
    "action_type": "click|type|scroll|...",
    "tag": "button", 
    "text": "Login",
    "xpath": "//button[@id='login']",
    "description": "Click on Login button"
}
```

### TestModule
